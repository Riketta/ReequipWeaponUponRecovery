# Reequip Weapon Upon Recovery
![alt text](About/Preview.png)

Keep weapon (and other inventory stuff for now) when downed and reequip it upon recovery.  

Successor of "Do Not Drop Weapon" and "Where Is My Weapon?" with better implementation.  

## Settings
Check mod settings.  
There you can find separate options for the player's colonists, enemies, inventory and weapons.  

## Why such a misleading name?
I started this project with the intention of simply reimplementing existing mods and named it accordingly, but it ended up being implemented much differently.
