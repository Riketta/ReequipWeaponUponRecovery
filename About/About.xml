	<description>Version 1.0.
Keep weapon (and other inventory stuff for now) when downed and reequip it upon recovery.

Successor of "Do Not Drop Weapon" and "Where Is My Weapon?" with better implementation.

Soon option to drop other inventory items will be added (to keep only weapon and not cheat with keeping other items, like intended in vanilla).
